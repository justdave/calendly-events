# Upcoming Events Registration List for Calendly

This WordPress plugin adds a shortcode to list upcoming scheduled events from Calendly using the Calendly API and offers registration links for already-scheduled group events that still have open slots. You can either list all of your scheduled events, or restrict it to a specific event type.

To set it up, you will need to log into Calendly and generate an Access Token.  A link to do so is provided on the settings page. Paste the token into the box on the settings page.

To use it, place the shortcode `[upcoming-for-calendly]` on a post or page where you want the list to appear. To restrict it to a specific event type, use `[upcoming-for-calendly event="Event Type Name"]`.

The plugin currently implements a feature I needed. I am open to adding additional features that can be implemented via Calendly's API if there is a need for them.

Bug reports and feature requests can be filed at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/justdave/upcoming-for-calendly/issues).

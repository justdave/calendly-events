# Upcoming Events Registration List for Calendly

This WordPress plugin adds a shortcode to list upcoming scheduled events from
Calendly using the Calendly API and offers registration links for
already-scheduled group events that still have open slots. You can either list
all of your scheduled events, or restrict it to a specific event type.

To set it up, you will need to log into Calendly and generate an Access Token.
A link to do so is provided on the settings page. Paste the token into the box
on the settings page.

To use it, place the shortcode `[upcoming-for-calendly]` on a post or page
where you want the list to appear. To restrict it to a specific event type,
use `[upcoming-for-calendly event="Event Type Name"]`.
